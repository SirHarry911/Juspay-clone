# Juspay-clone
Juspay Clone created using core HTML and CSS (Without Functionalities)

In this Assignment I have created a clone of the website using HTML & CSS and where all my knowledge of the following languages was put to test.
In this I have attempted to make the clone site as user-friendly as possible keeping in mind the resposiveness and the presentation of the content.
This assignment allowed me how big tech companies market their products and services to the masses. It was definitely a very informative and enjoyable experience creating
this website.
